# Rust_Diesel_Calculator
This is an HTML code that creates a Rust Diesel Calculator webpage. The page allows users to input a number, which represents the amount of diesel they want to use, and the page then calculates the amount of resources that can be obtained using that amount of diesel.

The page has a background color of #151413 and uses the Rust font for all text. The page is divided into two sections, each of which has a form for inputting the amount of diesel to be used. The first section calculates the resources that can be obtained from using the diesel in a quarry, while the second section calculates the resources that can be obtained from using the diesel in a giant excavator.

The calculations are done using JavaScript, and the results are displayed in a table that shows the amount of high-quality metal ore, sulfur ore, metal fragments, and stones that can be obtained, as well as the time it takes to obtain them. The results are formatted using a function that adds spaces to large numbers for readability.

Overall, the page provides a useful tool for Rust players who want to optimize their resource gathering by using diesel efficiently.
