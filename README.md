<a href="https://napoii.github.io/Rust-Online-Tools/">Rust Diesel Calculator Online Tool</a>


This is a simple HTML page with CSS and JavaScript that calculates the resources required for running a quarry or a giant excavator in the game Rust. The user inputs the number of fuel units they want to use and the page calculates the resources required for that amount of fuel.

## Getting Started

Clone or download the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in your browser.

## Usage

Enter the number of fuel units you want to use in the input field and the page will calculate the required resources for that amount of fuel. The results will be displayed in a table with three columns - one for a quarry, one for a giant excavator, and one for the time in minutes.
